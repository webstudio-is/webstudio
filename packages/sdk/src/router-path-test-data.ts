/**
 * Shared test data for router path validation.
 *
 * This file exports test cases that should be used consistently across:
 * 1. Path schema validation (SDK) - OldPagePath, page paths, etc.
 * 2. URLPattern matching (builder) - used for all page routing
 * 3. Route generation for published sites (react-sdk)
 *
 * These paths are used for pages, redirects, and any routable URL.
 * Add new test cases here to ensure all layers are tested with the same data.
 *
 * Reference: React Router path matching tests
 * https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/packages/react-router/__tests__
